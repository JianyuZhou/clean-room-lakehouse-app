Privacy-First Collaborative Lakehouse Application for LLM Fine-Tuning

This repository hosts a pioneering lakehouse application designed for privacy-centric collaboration in machine learning (ML). Imagine Company A, lacking in-house ML expertise, wishes to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) using their proprietary data. Collaborating with an AI firm like OpenAI poses a challenge: how to leverage their expertise without compromising data privacy?

Enter our Databricks clean room solution: a secure environment where Company A and OpenAI can collaborate effectively without direct data sharing. Company A uploads its dataset to the clean room, while OpenAI contributes their fine-tuning code and base LLM model.

Key Workflow:

Secure Collaboration: OpenAI drafts a Python notebook outlining their data ingestion and LLM fine-tuning process.
Review and Approval: Ensuring privacy, Company A reviews and approves the notebook, maintaining control over data use.
Privacy-First Output: The fine-tuned model, crafted in the clean room, is exclusively accessible to Company A, preventing OpenAI from accessing the refined model.
Lakehouse Application Integration: Company A utilizes the model within a lakehouse app, akin to traditional apps accessing databases, enabling seamless data access for user queries.
This application exemplifies how cutting-edge AI and data privacy can coexist, enabling companies to harness the power of AI while safeguarding their sensitive data.
